# House-Sales-and-Regression

<p align="center"><project-description></p>

### Introduction

A dataset on housing information, including number of rooms, square feet, and sales price, were explored and regression models were created.  R2 and adjusted R2 metrics look at sale price as a function of square foot of lot and the correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination were evaluated. Confidence intervals and analysis of variance of the original model, and the model created with additional predictors were compared. Casewise diagnostics were completed to identify outliers by residuals, standardized residuals, and studentized residuals, and influential cases by Cook's distance, DFBeta, DFFit, hat values and convariance ratio. A new data frame, casewise_diagnostics, was created to store these variables. A seperate variable has been created to store the large residuals (large_residual), which tells us True or False. True that it is a large residual, greater than 2 or less than -2, or False that the residual falls between 2 and -2. Plots were created and conclusions were drawn that the model appears accurate.
